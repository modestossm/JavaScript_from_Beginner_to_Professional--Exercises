// In this exercise, you will create a counter that will output the values in sequence using Promises.

// 1. Set up a Promise that resolves with a value of Start Counting.
// 2. Create a function named counter() that has one argument that gets the value and outputs it into the console.
// 3. Set up the next function in the Promise with four then() instances, which should output a value into the counter function, and return a value which will provide input for the subsequent then() instance. The returned values should be one, then two, then three. 

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    resolve("Start Counting");
});

function counter(val){
    console.log(val);
}

myPromise 
.then(value => {counter(value); return "one"})
.then(value => {counter(value); return "two"})
.then(value => {counter(value); return "three"})
.then(value => {counter(value);});
